# 📈 Signal Processing in Python 
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts to help organize and apply concepts in signal processing. It includes topics from frequency domain representation to the application of various filters on real-world signals. 

Note: I continue to add new notebooks as I study additional filters.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `1. Introduction.ipynb`: Introduction to signals, their representation and why ideal filters are impractical.
- `2. FourierTransform.ipynb`: Understanding the Fourier Transform.
- `3. Butterworth.ipynb`: Exploring Butterworth filters, Gibbs phenomenon, and practical application.
- `src/`: Contains python files with some created functions.
- `data/`: Datasets used in for example.
- `images/`: Images used in the notebooks.


## 📝 Topics Covered
- Frequency Domain Representation: 📈 Explanation and intuition behind representing signals in the frequency domain.
- Fourier Transform: 🔄 Mathematical and intuitive understanding of the Fourier Transform.
- Filters: 🧹 Different types of filters, why ideal filters can't be used, and the Gibbs phenomenon. Includes practical examples and applications.
- Real-World Application: 🌐 Applying filters to real vibration signals and analyzing the effects.
